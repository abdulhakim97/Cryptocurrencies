# Cryptocurrencies
-----------------------------------------------------------
# Overview:
## The purpose of this project was to analyze a dataset from many alternative cryptocurrencies to spot trends that make a firm or person want to invest in them. The problem with cryptos is that the most common ones, like bitcoin or ethereum, are becoming unaffordable for the common public. That being said, I will be using unsupervised machine learning to see if we can spot any trends that result in opportunities of these altcoins.

# Results:
## Follow the code closely in the crypto_clustering.ipynb

# Summary:
## The job of unsupervised machine learning is to discover patterns or groups of data when there is no known output. This analysis was successful at grouping cryptocurrencies into 4 groups. If we were to create a crypto investment portfolio we would need to further analyze the clusters.
